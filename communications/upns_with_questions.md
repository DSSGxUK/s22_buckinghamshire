Below we've compiled a list of UPNs we wanted your help with understanding. We've only included UPNs and dataset cohorts below for data security purposes. We did not want to send sensitive data over email.

There's about 30 UPNs in this list; no need to look at all of them, just whatever you have time for would be helpful.

# Why are some rows completely duplicated?

Some rows in the datasets are completely duplicated, and they are all missing a UPN. I could not find any completely duplicate rows that have a UPN. Maybe the duplicates without UPNs are different but similar people. Here's an example from the Feb '21 dataset:

1. rows 2424 and 2494 - 2021 - these rows are exactly the same. The UPN is missing in these rows.

# Why do some UPNs appear more than once per cohort?

# Why do some NEET young people not have a NEET start date?

All the young people who are NEET but have no NEET start date are currently seeking work. Here are some example UPNs:
1. C34659467094630 - 2020
2. V34662692484084 - 2022
3. A34658404284336 - 2022

However, there are many young people who are currently seeking work that have NEET start dates:
1. M34658488244646 - 2021
2. U12908742211428 - 2020
3. X34658450569050 - 2019


Is it not required to record a NEET start date if the young person is currently seeking work?
