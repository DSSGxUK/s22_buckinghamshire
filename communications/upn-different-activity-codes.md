These UPNs have multiple entries with different different activity codes:
- D34658446410840 - 2020 - different activities around the same time of each other
- Z34659139538184 - 2021 - different activities around the same time of each other

- K12650488414872 - 2018 - different activities around the same time of each other

Some of the common differences in activities I've noticed are:
- changes from *FTEFurtherEducation* to *SchSixthForm* or vice-versa
- changes from an activity code to *NotKnown* or vice-versa.
